# Naming Conventions

Each Node (peripheral or bus) exposes three distinct name categories.

### 1. BASE_NAME

- Identifies the type or family of the node.
- Case insensitive
- Composed ONLY of alphanumeric characters.

Examples:

- `TIM` for a timer peripheral
- `DDR4` for a ddr memory interface

Used to group multiple instances of the same kind and to create the correct objects inside "factories".
Think of it like the "type" of a particular node.

### 2. FULL_NAME 

- Specified in the `RANGE_NAMES` in the `.csv` files to refer to a particular istance of peripheral or bus 
- Unique name of the node within the global system.
- Duplicate FULL_NAMEs are forbidden.
- Uses the format

        {BASE_NAME}{s*}

Where `s` is a "separator" character (basically every non alphanumeric character) for example `_`
and `*` is a wildcard string, so anything that can be used to differentiate two nodes of the
same type, ex. `TIM_0` and `TIM_1` or `TIM_A` and `TIM_B`.
`s` can be omitted if there is a single node of type `BASE_NAME` in the full configuration, for example
since MBUS node is always a single istance its FULL_NAME is also `MBUS`.
`*` can optionally be empty, for example `TIM` and `TIM_` are effectively 2 different FULL_NAMEs.
The only exceptions are `DDR4` nodes.
For a DDR node the format expected is

    {BASE_NAME}{s*}_{id}

where `id` MUST be a number and is the "channel" identifier.
examples: `DDR4_CH_0` or `DDR4_CH_1`.

FULL_NAMEs are assumed to be used in the generation of every file in the configuration, so keep in mind
that when specifying a particular node with a FULL_NAME, that name will be used to refer to that particular node in the context of the various configuration files (as it is, or as a prefix/suffix based on the particular configuration file).
So every "sw" or "hw" file that depends on generated files, will be influenced by the particular FULL_NAME given
to a node in the configuration flow.

### 3. RANGE_NAME

- Identifies a specific address range belonging to a node.
- Formed from the node’s FULL_NAME plus a range index:
    `{FULL_NAME}_range_{id}`
- If a node has a single address range, its RANGE_NAME equals its FULL_NAME.
- Examples:
    - `TIM_1_range_0`
    - `TIM_1_range_1`
- RANGE_NAMEs provide fine-grained reachability control; buses may reach some ranges but not others.

The name is unfortunate because they COULD be different from the `RANGE_NAMES` expressed in a `.csv` file (for example if a node FULL_NAME is configured with multiple address ranges), they are
internally generated by the configuration flow and kept inside `Addr_Range` objects.
Their only use for now is inside the file generated by `config_dump` file, to get a more precise view of the
address ranges each bus can reach.
